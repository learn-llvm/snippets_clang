snippets_clang
==============

This repo contains several clang-specific code snippets, including using [libclang](libclang), [libclang with python bindings](libclang-py), and [clang libtooling](tooling) out-of-tree (no need to build LLVM/Clang from sources). The LLVM/Clang version tries to catch up with the latest official released version.
